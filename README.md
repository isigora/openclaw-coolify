## 🌟 Overview
This is not just a chatbot. It is a **Personal Operations Platform (POP)** that gives you a fully autonomous AI team. It runs 24/7, manages its own sub-workers, deploys code, scrapes the web, and maintains your digital life.

### **Key Capabilities**
*   **🛠️ AI Team in a Box**: Acts as your Prompt Engineer, UI/UX Designer, DevOps, and Backend Dev.
*   **📦 Sandbox Manager**: Spawns isolated Docker containers ("Workers") for projects (Next.js, Python, PHP, etc.).
*   **🌐 Live Deployment**: Automatically exposes new workers via Cloudflare Tunnels (public URLs instantly).
*   **🕸️ Universal Scraper**:
    *   **Level 1**: `Curl` (Fast/Static)
    *   **Level 2**: `HyperBrowser` (AI Navigation)
    *   **Level 3**: `Browser-Use` (Headless Python Agents)
    *   **Level 4**: `Botasaurus` (Anti-Detect)
    *   **Level 5**: `AnyCrawl` (API Fallback)
*   **🧠 Self-Training**: Records learned patterns and skills to `SOUL.md` and `skills/` directory.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Multi-Agent Sandbox Architecture
The main `bot` container acts as the Orchestrator. It can:
-   **Create Workers**: `create_sandbox.sh --stack nextjs` -> Spawns a Bun/Next.js container.
-   **Tunnel Access**: Assigns a `https://ProjectName.trycloudflare.com` URL automatically.
-   **Persist Data**: All state managed in `sandboxes.db` (SQLite).

### 2. Advanced Web Tools (`skills/web-utils`)
Stop worrying about bot detection. The platform includes a unified 5-stage scraper:
```bash
# Intelligent Auto-Mode (Retries all strategies)
skills/web-utils/scripts/scrape.sh --mode auto "https://blocked-site.com"
```

### 3. Integrated Services
The `docker-compose.yaml` template includes the essentials:
-   **Moltbot/OpenClaw**: The brain.
-   **SearXNG**: Private, tracking-free web search (JSON enabled).
-   *(Optional via Dashboard)*: Qdrant, Miniflux, Linkding.

### 4. Smart Deployment
*   **Cloudflare Tunnels**: Just set `CF_TUNNEL_TOKEN` for instant public URLs.
*   **Vercel + GitHub**:
    *   Auto-creates **Private Repos**.
    *   Refactors local DBs (SQLite) to **Vercel KV/Postgres** automatically.
    *   Verifies build (self-repair) before pushing.
    *   Syncs `.env` secrets.

## 🧠 Self-Training (The Soul)
This agent is designed to learn. It records new patterns and capabilities in:
-   `SOUL.md`: Core identity and lessons.
-   `skills/`: Executable tool definitions.
-   `docs/`: Knowledge base.
